# Project 5 - Automated Climate Control

## Intro

Once set up, this project will sense and record ambient temperature and toggle relays based on the temperature value. This is a simple demonstration of an automated control system that can be remotely monitored.

This project requires the Ci40 and 2 Clicker boards from Creator Kit. It also uses all 3 Click boards.

## Steps

To complete these steps, refer to the [Toolbox](http://localhost:8000/Toolbox) for detailed descriptions of each action required.

* Get the code: [Pre-built Release](http://github.com) or [Source Code](http://github.com)
* [Flash](http://localhost:8000/Toolbox/#programming-a-6lowpan-clicker) the ""Temperature"" hex file onto one Clicker board - Make a note of which one it is
* [Flash](http://localhost:8000/Toolbox/#programming-a-6lowpan-clicker) the ""Relay"" hex file onto the second Clicker board - Make a note of which one it is
* [Connect](http://localhost:8000/Toolbox/#connecting-ci40-to-the-internet) Ci40 to the Internet
* On your Ci40, run the ""command"" command
* [Provision](http://localhost:8000/Toolbox/#provisioning-ci40) Ci40
* Power on both Clicker boards
* [Provision](http://localhost:8000/Toolbox/#provisioning-clicker) the Clickers via the Ci40 web interface
* Press the button on the Button Clicker
* Observe the LED on the LED Clicker
* Log into your FlowCloud account and navigate to the Message Viewer - Observe it when you press the Button
