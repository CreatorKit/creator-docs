**Ci40** - Ci40 is largest board in your kit and is the IoT hub. It connects to the Internet, and has many connectivity options for constrained devices to connect to (WiFi/6LowPAN/BlueTooth). See full details of Ci40 on the [FlowM2M website](http://www.flowcloud.io)

**IoT** - Abbreviation of "Internet of Things". IoT is a concept in which many devices are connected together to work more efficiently/effectively. Any system in which multiple devices are connected together and connected to the Internet can be considered to be an IoT system.

**Contrained Device** - This term is a catch-all for very simple devices that connect to your Ci40 in a local network. Your Clicker boards included in the kit are an example of a Constrained Device.

**OpenWRT** - This is the operating system used on Ci40 for the Creator Kit projects. Ci40 can run a variety of operating systems, but OpenWRT is used in these examples. [Openwrt website](https://openwrt.org/)

**6LowPan Clicker** - 2 6LowPAN Clicker boards are included in the Creator Kit to allow you to complete hte 5 projects. Each Clicker connects to the Ci40 over 6LowPAN and acts as a remote sensor/actuator by using Click boards

**Click** - 3 Click boards are included in your kit (Thermo3, Relay, PIR Motion Sensor) and many more are available from [MikroElektronika](http://www.mikroe.com/click/). These boards can be used to add new functions to your Clicker and Ci40 boards.
