# Scope

Creator Kit has been designed to be the building blocks of your IoT solution. Ci40 is the hub and gateway, Clicker boards offer remote sensors and actuators, and FlowM2M services allow data to be sent, stored and visualized.

The kit itself has 5 example projects which are detailed in this guide. Setting them up is easy, and will give you a working IoT system. These examples are open source and therefore useful not only as a learning resource, but also as the starting point for your own project. This covers embedded software for Ci40 and Clicker boards, as well as iOS/Android apps, and FlowM2M services like LWM2M messaging.

## The Example Projects

#### Project 1 - IoT Button
[Click here to view the project page](Project 1.md)

The first project will allow you to press a button on one Clicker board and turn on an LED on the other. This establishes the basics of communication between your devices. Ci40 acts as the hub for this communication and also ensures that messages are recorded on FlowM2M via the Message Viewer on the FlowM2M website.

After getting this project running, browsing through the source code will give you an insight into how to send messages between devices on your network.
